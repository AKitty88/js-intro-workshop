// Level 3

/*
   WooHoo, you got so far on your first day! Great! But we still have more things for you.
   First of all, go to index.html file and replace our script from level2.js to current
   file - level3.js

    Here we will talk a bit more about HTML, CSS and how JS can interact with them.
    So HTML - stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a structure of the elements
    on the page.

    HTML:
    As you noticed it is divided on elements that looks like that:
    <header></header>, <p></p> etc - it is tags, each element on the page has opening
    and closing tag (NOTE: some tags are self-closing like <img>). Whole html file is wrapped
    in tag <html>, which contains of <head> and <body> tags. In <head> we keep different
    meta information, title and link to css files. <Body> contains our actual content.
    Tags has a set of names which you can find here http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/

    Any tag also can have different properties (<div class="settings"></div> - tag div
    has a property class, that has name = 'settings').

    CSS:
    Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be
    displayed on screen. As you can see in css file when we need to target any element
    we can simply refer to the tag itself (footer{color: white;}), or to any property (class
    via '.settings', id via '#logo' etc). The list of css properties is huge, you can check
    on it here https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html but don't worry, you don't need to
    remember it all.
    PS: difference between id and class is that tag with specific 'id' should be unique on
    the page, but many tags can have same class within the same page. Use 'id' only if
    you really need it!!

    Phew, lot's of new things. But let's come back to javaScript and see how we can interact
    with html.
